!Determine the logical value of each of the following expressions. Write a pro-
!gram to test your answers.
CHARACTER(LEN=4) :: name = ’Adam’

name > ’Eve’              ! .false.
“ADAM” > name             ! .true.
’M1’ < ’M25’              ! .true.
’version_1’ > ’version-2’ ! .true.
’ more’ < ’more’          ! .true.

!Here's what the book says about these intrinsic string comparison functions
!LGT(string1, string2) !greater than or equal to 
!LGE(string1, string2) !greater than
!LLE(string1, string2) !less than or equal to 
!LLT(string1, string2) !less than

LGT("Adam","adam")        ! .true.
LLT("Me",’me’)            ! .false.
LLT(’me’,"me?")           ! .true.

The results from first running the program were not what I expected.
 Expecting .false.
 F
 Expecting .true. "ADAM" > name == .false.
    Because ASCII 'A' is < than 'a'?
    I think they are '65' and '97'or 01000001 and 01100001 
    ... *sigh* yep, that was a silly mistake and may be the root of my other mistakes
    I'm going to fix it and test again as it might just resolve all the errors.
    Yeah, that did the trick.
 F
 Expecting .true.
 T
 Expecting .true.
 T
 Expecting .true.
 T
 Expecting .true.

 Expecting .false.
